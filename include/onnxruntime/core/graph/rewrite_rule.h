@class RewriteRule 

The base class for a rewrite rule. A rewrite rule represents a semantics-preserving
transformation of a computation-graph. It can be used to represent, for example,
the elimination of operators that serve as no-ops (for example, dropout during
inference), as well as inlining of "function" definitions or the dual (replacing
a complex expression by an equivalent function-call). Unlike the more general
IGraphTransformer, a rewrite-rule is applied at a single node, representing the
root of an expression that is rewritten.
